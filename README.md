# Lottery simulator. My first personal project.

## What it does
Creates a player's row and a winning row. Then compares the rows and stores the result in an array. This is repeated until desired score is achieved or maximum simulation length is met. Then prints scores on the page. Simulation runs in the browser which means that the page does not respond during the simulation.


## To do:
  -style the page
  -write instructions on the page
  -add links to linkedin and facebook
